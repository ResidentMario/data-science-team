    "1. Download the [Anaconda&mdash;Python 3.5 distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).\n",
    "2. Verify that your installation worked: open Terminal or Command Console. If you've never done so before, Google for instructions on doing so for your OS in question&mdash;shouldn't be hard. Got it open? Good; now type in `python --version`. If all is well, you should get `Python 3.4.1` or `Python 3.5.0` or `Python 3.5.1` (plus minus some text about it being an `Anaconda` distribution).\n",
    "3. Type in and run `git`. If this results in an error you still have to install it (it's provided by default on Linux and OSX machines): [get the appropriate version here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then type in and run `git`&mdash;as long as you don't get back an error you know it's working.\n",
