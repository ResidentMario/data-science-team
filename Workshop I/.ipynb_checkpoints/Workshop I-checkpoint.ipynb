For our problem we will be using an API---specifically, the Yelp! API. We need a list of coordinates of chain store locations in Manhattan, and---lo and behold---Yelp! provides us with just such a list! We just have to figure out how to get it out of their hands into ours.\n",

Until you become a pro (and even often then) you will almost never have much of an idea about what you should do to answer a particular question, and will instead have to research your options and pick the best one (if one is available at all!)."

    "2. Every Yelp! account is able to generate and use an API key, which needs to be passed to be passed to the website for every query, for security/monetization/rate limiting purposes. [Generate your own API key here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/manage_api_keys). You'll need this information during the workshop!\n",
    "3. Download and install the [Anaconda Python 3.5 distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Note that this is a fairly sizable library: Anaconda is the gold standard of data science and so includes stable versions of most of the heavyweight tools that you will need for data science.\n",
    "4. Verify that your installation worked: open `Terminal` or `Command Console`. If you've never done so before, Google for instructions on doing so for your OS in question--shouldn't be hard. Got it open? Good; now type in `python`. If all is well, this should open the Python interpreter: to make sure you installed the right version of Python, type in `print(\"Hello world!\")` and make sure that doesn't raise an error message. Once done, get out with `close()`.\n",
    "5. Type (copy-paste) into the console: `pip install yelp folium requests geojson geopy`. This will install all of the listed libraries--more on what a library is later--that we will use for this project.\n",

    "    IDs are constructed name-location-number, so we just have to check numbers in ascending order until it breaks.\n",

    "    2.  Yelp IDs are unique and are not reassigned when a location is closed.\n",
    "        Thus we need to check for and exclude closed locations when munging the data.\n",
    "    3.  Places with a single instance in Manhattan sometimes have a \"name-place-2\" that redirects to their only location.\n",
    "        At least this seems to be the case with Bibble & Sip...\n",
    "        This is checked and corrected for further down the line, by the fetch_businesses() method.\n",

    "        e.g. the best-buy-3 id points to a non-existant storefront.\n",
    "        But best-buy-4, best-buy-5, and so on actually exist!\n",
    "        Yelp acknowledges this fact, but still returns a BusinessUnavaialable error when queries.\n",
    "        This method sends a web request and checks the response and terminates on a 404, which has proven to be a reliable\n",
    "        way of circumnavigating this issue.\n",
    "    5.  In case the above doesn't work...\n",
    "        The manual_override parameter forces the fetcher to keep moving past this error.\n",
    "        For debugging purposes, this method prints a URL for the purposes of manually checking breakpoints.\n",
    "        That way you can incrementally run fetch() and then comb over trouble spots you find by moving up manual_override.\n",
    "        If you hit that URL and you get either a valid ID or an invalid but existing ID, you need to bump up manual_override\n",
    "        to correct it and rerun the fetch.\n",
    "        If you hit that URL and you get a 404 page then you're done!\n",
